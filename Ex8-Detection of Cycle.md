# Ex8 Detection of Cycle and Finding the Starting Node in a Linked List
## DATE:17-09-2026
## AIM:
To write a program that detects a cycle in a linked list and returns the node where the cycle begins.
If there is no cycle, the program should return null without modifying the linked list.
## Algorithm
1.Start slow = head and fast = head.

2.Move slow by 1 step and fast by 2 steps until they meet or fast becomes null.

3.If fast becomes null, return null (no cycle).

4.Move slow to head, keep fast at meeting point.

5.Move both one step at a time until they meet — this node is the cycle start.

        Node(int data) {
            this.data = data;
            this.next = null;
        }
    }

    static Node detectCycle(Node head) {
        if (head == null || head.next == null) 
            return null;

        Node slow = head;
        Node fast = head;

        while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
            slow = slow.next;          
            fast = fast.next.next;     

            if (slow == fast) {        
                break;
            }
        }

        if (fast == null || fast.next == null)
            return null;

        slow = head;
        while (slow != fast) {
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next;
        }

        return slow;   
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Node head = new Node(1);
        head.next = new Node(2);
        head.next.next = new Node(3);
        head.next.next.next = new Node(4);
        head.next.next.next.next = new Node(5);

        head.next.next.next.next.next = head.next.next;

        Node cycleStart = detectCycle(head);

        if (cycleStart != null)
            System.out.println("Cycle starts at node: " + cycleStart.data);
        else
            System.out.println("No cycle detected.");
    }
}

## Result:
The program successfully detects whether a cycle exists in the linked list.
If a cycle is present, it correctly identifies and returns the node where the cycle begins.
